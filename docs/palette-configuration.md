# CONFIGURING YOUR COLOR PALETTE
--------------------------------

Its important to note that the colors configured using the "Nocturnal Neon Lights" theme are not like configuring a theme using the language-independent JSON API created by VSCode. With nocturnal there are only a small handful of colors that you will choose, but do not underestimate the power, or the level of configurable that nocturnal has. Changing Nocturnal's color settings has profound implications that make using VS Code fun & exciting.

ColorPalettes are configured by defining 3 different colors. Unlike a custom-defined theme written using VS Code's API that has been implemented using the language-independent data interchange format known as JSON define a custom theme using the VS Code theme API which is written in the ECMA standardized interchangeable data format known as **JSON** (ECMA-4)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. the primary color that the theme will use for highlighting

  2. the secondary color that will be used as a more subtle highlight, and is often made to be transparent.

  3. And the lastly is the accent color which will add a bit of color to the dark neutrality of your theme, this helps to liven things up.

# Late Night Programming

##### Late Night Programming is a collection of dark V.S. Code themes

I have ADHD, I have been a very hyper and easily distracted individual for my entire life, as a consequence, I have become a nocturnal programmer. Only when everyone else is sleeping, and in bed, am I able to produce my best work. Everyone is individually unique in one way or another, so it doesn't bother me that while the rest of the world is getting up and drinking coffee at six in the morning, I am just getting into bed. Working all night like that has pros, and cons, but I am not authoring this excerpt to speak about those. During the night, well after midnight, there's a particular ambience that can consistantly be felt, every night, night after night. And it does not matter where in the world you are at, the mood is indestinguishable, and can be felt.
It is this ambiance that I have tried to capture, and put into my work. I really approached this theme as a piece of art. I have worked on it for well over 2 years now, and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do.
